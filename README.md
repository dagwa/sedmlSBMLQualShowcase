# sedmlSBMLQualShowcase
This is going to be a set of examples showcasing how (extended) SED-ML can be applied to SBML Qual models. 
The idea of a github-based, fully featured showcase is taken from the [CombineArchiveShowcase](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineArchiveShowCase).  

## examples contained in this showcase

We used four examples to demonstrate how SED-ML would be used for experiments run on SBML Qual models:

 *  MAPK model: taken from the [GinSim repository](http://ginsim.org/node/173)
 * Toy model: taken from the SBML Qual Specification [Section 4.1](http://co.mbine.org/specifications/sbml.level-3.version-1.qual.version-1.release-1.pdf)
 * Lambda phage model: taken from the GinSim tutorial
 * Petri net model: taken from the SBML Qual Specification [Section 4.3](http://co.mbine.org/specifications/sbml.level-3.version-1.qual.version-1.release-1.pdf)
